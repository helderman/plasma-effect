Click the green flag, watch, enjoy!
Click the stage or press space to change image.
Adjust the slider at the bottom to make the animation go faster, slower, or even the other way around.

Ideal as a weird 'animated stage' in any project you like. All it takes is one image and one tiny code block - so remix at will, or use the 'backpack' to copy objects to your existing project.
